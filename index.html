				<h3>Fine Artist</h3> <!-- Job Title One -->

				<p>From drawing Simba in red Crayola, to my AP Studio Senior Thesis, to graduating with a BFA 
					in Painting, fine art takes precendence in my history as an artist. Nothing fulfills
					me quite like a thick glob of oil smeared onto freshly gessoed canvas, worked into feelings, 
					turned into something beautiful.</p>

				<h3>Digital Designer</h3> <!-- Job Title Two -->

				<p>After landing a role in marketing, my eyes were opened to a world in which I could combine my
					skills as a fine artist, with my interest in technology and my passion for storytelling. 
					My focus is on idea generation, content creation, and creating aesthetic experiences that 
					tell a story and inspire the imagination.</p>

				<h3>Storyteller</h3> <!-- Job Title Three -->

				<p>I believe that great design speaks for itself, and that sharing your unique story with the world 
					is what truly drives business. I design content that tells a story. But not just any story - <strong>your
					story</strong>. In sharing your story, whether personal or professional, connections are found.
					Creating a connection to you and your brand doesn't just generate buyers - it generates <em>loyal
					customers</em>.</p>
